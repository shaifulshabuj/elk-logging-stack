# Kibana Dashboard Creation Guide

This guide walks you through the process of creating custom dashboards in Kibana to visualize and analyze your log data.

## Prerequisites

- ELK Stack up and running
- Log data being ingested into Elasticsearch
- Access to Kibana at http://localhost:5601

## Understanding Kibana Components

Before creating dashboards, it's helpful to understand the key components:

1. **Index Patterns**: Define which Elasticsearch indices to query
2. **Visualizations**: Individual charts, graphs, and data displays
3. **Dashboards**: Collections of visualizations arranged on a canvas
4. **Saved Searches**: Reusable search queries that can be the basis for visualizations

## Creating Custom Visualizations

### Step 1: Create a New Visualization

1. Navigate to **Kibana** → **Visualize** in the left-hand menu
2. Click **Create new visualization**
3. Select the visualization type that best suits your data:
   - **Area/Line**: For time-series data (e.g., logs over time)
   - **Bar**: For comparing different categories
   - **Pie**: For showing proportions
   - **Data Table**: For raw numbers
   - **Metric**: For single-value displays
   - **Tag Cloud**: For text frequency analysis
   - Other specialized visualizations

### Step 2: Select a Source

After selecting a visualization type, you'll need to choose a source:

1. Select an existing **index pattern** that contains your log data
2. Optionally, you can base the visualization on a **saved search**

### Step 3: Configure the Visualization

#### Example: Creating a Line Chart of Logs Over Time

1. Select **Line** visualization type
2. Choose your index pattern (e.g., `application-*`)
3. In the **Metrics** section, configure the Y-axis:
   - Select **Count** for simple log counts
   - Or choose a specific metric like **Average** of a numeric field
4. In the **Buckets** section, add an X-axis:
   - Select **Date Histogram**
   - Choose the **@timestamp** field
   - Set an appropriate interval (auto, minute, hour, day)
5. Optionally, add **Split Series** or **Split Chart** to break down by a field:
   - Click **Add sub-buckets**
   - Select **Split Series**
   - Choose **Terms** aggregation
   - Select a field like **level.keyword** or **service.keyword**
   - Set the number of values to display

### Step 4: Customize and Save

1. Use the **Options** tab to customize the appearance
2. Click **Update** to refresh the visualization
3. When satisfied, click **Save** in the top right
4. Give your visualization a descriptive name
5. Click **Save** again

## Building a Dashboard

### Step 1: Create a New Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Kibana** → **Dashboard** in the left-hand menu
2. Click **Create new dashboard**

### Step 2: Add Visualizations

1. Click **Add** in the top right
2. Select from your saved visualizations
3. Repeat to add multiple visualizations

### Step 3: Arrange and Resize

1. **Drag** visualizations to reposition them
2. Use the **resize handles** to adjust the size
3. Create logical groupings of related visualizations

### Step 4: Add Filters and Search

1. Use the **filter bar** at the top to add dashboard-wide filters
2. Create filters like `service: "authentication-service"` or `level: "ERROR"`
3. Use the **search bar** for full-text search across the dashboard

### Step 5: Save the Dashboard

1. Click **Save** in the top right
2. Give your dashboard a descriptive name
3. Optionally, check **Store time with dashboard** to save the current timeframe
4. Click **Save** again

## Creating Advanced Dashboards

### Using Dashboard Drilldowns

You can create interactive dashboards where clicking on one visualization filters others:

1. In edit mode, select a visualization
2. Click **Actions** → **Create drilldown**
3. Select **Dashboard drilldown**
4. Choose a target dashboard
5. Configure how field values are passed between dashboards

### Creating Dashboard-Only Visualizations

You can create visualizations that only exist in the context of a dashboard:

1. In dashboard edit mode, click **Create new**
2. Select the visualization type
3. Configure as normal
4. The visualization will be saved with the dashboard

### Adding Text Panels

Add context and instructions to your dashboard:

1. In dashboard edit mode, click **Add** → **Add a markdown panel**
2. Use markdown syntax to format text
3. Include headings, lists, links, and formatting

Example markdown:
```markdown
## Authentication Service Monitoring

This dashboard shows key metrics for the authentication service:

* Login success/failure rates
* Geographic distribution of login attempts
* Error rates by authentication method

**Note**: Filter by date range using the time picker above.
```

## Dashboard Best Practices

### Organization

- Group related visualizations together
- Place most important metrics at the top
- Use consistent sizing for similar visualizations
- Add text panels to provide context and instructions

### Design

- Use a consistent color scheme
- Don't overcrowd the dashboard
- Ensure each visualization has a clear purpose
- Make titles descriptive but concise

### Performance

- Limit the number of visualizations per dashboard (< 20)
- Use appropriate time ranges
- Consider using smaller data samples for large datasets
- Test dashboard load times

## Sharing Dashboards

Share dashboards with your team:

1. Navigate to your saved dashboard
2. Click **Share** in the top right
3. Choose from sharing options:
   - **Short URL**: Get a shortened link
   - **Snapshot**: Create a point-in-time snapshot
   - **Embed Code**: Get HTML to embed in other applications
   - **Export**: Save as JSON for backup or transfer
